1. Strictly Binary Tree (Full Binary Tree):

Every non-leaf node has exactly two children.

Total nodes with  leaves: .

All nodes have either 0 or 2 children (no node has only one child).



---

2. Complete Binary Tree:

All levels except possibly the last one are fully filled.

All leaves are at the last level .

Total nodes for depth : .

Total leaves at the last level: .



---

3. Almost Complete Binary Tree:

All levels are fully filled except possibly the last.

Leaves are either at the last level  or the second-to-last level .

Subcategories:

Strictly Binary Almost Complete Tree:

Total nodes: , where  is the number of leaves.


Non-Strictly Binary Almost Complete Tree:

Total nodes: , where  is the number of leaves.


Exactly two distinct structures exist for  leaves (one strictly binary and one not).


With  nodes:

Only one structure exists.

It is strictly binary if  is odd and not strictly binary if  is even.
